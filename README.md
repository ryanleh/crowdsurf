<h1 align="center">CrowdSurf</h1>

__CrowdSurf__ is a Go library for **distributional private information retrieval**.

This library was initially developed as part of the paper *"Distributional Private Information Retrieval"*, and is released under the MIT License and the Apache v2 License (see [License](#license)).

**WARNING:** This is an academic proof-of-concept prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review. It should NOT be used for production use.

## Directory structure

This repository contains several folders that implement the different building blocks of CrowdSurf. The high-level structure of the repository is as follows.

* [`batching`](batching): Batch codes for handling batch PIR queries.

* [`benches`](benches): Benchmarks used in the paper

* [`crypto`](crypto): Core cryptographic components 

* [`external`](external): External libraries for building and benchmarking

* [`lhe`](lhe): A linearly homomorphic encryption scheme with preprocessing

* [`matrix`](matrix): Code for fast matrix multiplication

* [`service`](service): Scaffolding for running end-to-end experiments

## Build guide

First, install Go (**version 1.22.12**â€“newer versions aren't supported at the moment) by downloading the appropriate archive from [here](https://go.dev/dl/) and following the installation directions [here](https://go.dev/doc/install). Then, ensure your machine has CMake, a C++ compiler (e.g., clang), and GMP. On Ubunutu, these can be installed via:
```
sudo apt install cmake clang libgmp-dev
```
Next, pull in external submodules:
```
git submodule update --init
```
> **Optional:** To run hint-compression (used in the end-to-end experiments), you will need to install Bazel (**version 7.2.1**) following the directions [here](https://bazel.build/install/ubuntu). Additionally, the python scripts below require the `numpy`, `tabulate`, and `pandas` Python3 libraries.

> **Optional:** To enable GPU-support, you need an NVIDIA GPU with [CUDA Toolkit 12.4](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive) installed. Ensure that CMake can find the CUDA installation; for Ubuntu, this can be done by adding the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:
>```
>export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
>export PATH=$PATH:$CUDA_HOME/bin
>export CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc
>```


Install the required C++ libraries:
```
cmake -S external/SEAL/ -B external/SEAL/build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/external/SEAL/build -DSEAL_USE_INTEL_HEXL=ON
cmake --build external/SEAL/build/ -j 8
cmake --install external/SEAL/build
cmake -S matrix/gpu/cuda -B matrix/gpu/cuda/build
cmake --build matrix/gpu/cuda/build/ -j 8
```

Finally, test that everything is working:
```
go test ./...
```


## Experiments

Below we outline how to recreate several of the key figures in our paper

### Figures 3, 4, and 9

The numbers for all of these figures can be obtained by running the `benches/run_benches.py`. In particular, to recreate Figure 3 run:
```
python3 run_benches.py -q
```
to recreate Figure 4 run:
```
python3 run_benches.py -p
```
(Note that if you add the `-r` flag, the benchmark is slightly more accurate
but will take a few hours to run).

Finally, to recreate Figure 9 run:
```
python3 run_benches.py -b
```

### Table 12

To get end-to-end estimates for the costs of CrowdSurf, you will need access to four machines: a client (anything with >4GB of memory), two CPU-based machines, and a GPU-based machine.

One of the CPU-based machines will be hint compression. On this machine, run the following two commands in different shells:
```
cd external/hintless_pir/dpir
bazel run -c opt //dpir:dpir_server
```
and
```
cd service/bin/server
go run . hint
```

The remaining CPU + GPU machines will be for PIR. On these machines run:
```
cd service/bin/server
go run . "pir"
```
Finally, make sure that all machines accept traffic on ports 8728/8729 and run the following command:
```
cd service
python3 run_e2e.py --pir_gpu $GPU_IP --pir_cpu $CPU1_IP --hint $CPU2_IP
```
which will output the costs displayed in Table 12.
